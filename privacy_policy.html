<h3>Privacy</h3>
Your privacy is very important to us. We created our privacy policy to make important disclosures about how you can use PanicGuard and how we collect and can use your content. We encourage you to read this agreement in full, and to use it to help make informed decisions.

<h3>Accessing and updating personal information</h3>
When you use PanicGuard services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests. We may decline to process requests at our discretion, for example if, in our opinion, requests are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, could jeopardize the privacy of others, could simply be impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. You may of course ask us to provide you with the personal information that we hold about you.

<h3>Cookies</h3>
What is a cookie? It’s a file which has within it an identifier (i.e. a combination of letters and numbers) that a web server sends to a browser to be stored by that browser. This assists the server in more quickly identifying the browser – as each time that this browser requests a page from the server it sends this identifier back to the server. We may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the website. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date. We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website; keep track of items in your shopping basket; prevent fraud and increase website security; and other uses. We will use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit; keep track of your preferences in relation to your use of our website; and other uses. We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users’ computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google’s privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html. Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies.

<h3>Sharing By You Of Your Content and Information</h3>
You acknowledge that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer and mobile phone to prevent unauthorized access to your account. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You should take all necessary steps to ensure that the password is kept confidential and secure and should inform us immediately if you have any reason to believe that your password has become known to anyone else, or if the password is being, or is likely to be, used in an unauthorized manner. You must not allow any third party to access your account.

<h3>Information security</h3>
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to PanicGuard employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to disciplinary measures, including termination of their employment or engagement, as well as criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

<h3>How we use Content</h3>
PanicGuard may use your Content in a variety of ways from time to time in performing the Services for you – including the following:

we will seek to track and record your phone’s position upon PanicGuard being activated in accordance with its proper use; and
we will seek to describe your phone’s position, and your details as known to us, to the relevant ARC, your nominated contact/s and/or emergency authorities;
those details are disclosed to any third party not being the ARC or your nominated contacts on an anonymous basis; and
we use the location service API within your phone to determine and track your location. Disabling this setting will prevent the app from working fully and we will therefore be unable to provide assistance in the event of you being in danger.
More generally, we may also disclose your personal information:

to update and/or administer our website or service;
to send you notices or other forms of communication which are not marketing;
on an anonymous basis, to use your information and/or supply the same to third parties, for statistical purposes;
if we are required to do so by law, code of practice or regulation;
in connection with actual or contemplated legal proceedings, including where we reasonably determine that a third party may apply for, and be successful in, the grant of a court (or other competent authority) order to disclose your information to that third party;
for the protection of our legal rights, including ascertaining the nature of those rights, exercising and/or defending the same with advice from professional third parties to whom we may disclose your information for such purpose/s; and
to any member of our group companies from time, our respective employees, directors, advisers, agents, clients and subcontractors, as reasonably required for the purposes f either this policy itself or the promotion and/or provision of our services.
<h3>Other websites</h3>
This website contains links to third party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any such third party websites.

<h3>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>
Please note that our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes).
